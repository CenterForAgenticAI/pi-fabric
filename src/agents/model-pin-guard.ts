/**
 * Child-side guard, loaded by the worker with -e only for `modelMatch: "exact"`.
 *
 * Pi swallows an exception thrown by an extension handler and goes on with the
 * request, so throwing is no veto. `ctx.abort()` also kept the provider from being
 * entered in Pi 1.0.4 probes, but only because credential lookup before the stream
 * honours the aborted signal, and the run would fail as a plain abort without a
 * fixed reason. Ending this process before the call depends on neither.
 *
 * Three checks, all against the pin:
 * - `model_select`: any switch away from the pin ends the child at once, so
 *   nothing runs on the other model afterwards, including the summaries that Pi's
 *   compaction and branch summarization build from the session's current model.
 *   Pi emits it only when the model changes, so the `--model` launch and Fabric's
 *   own `set_model` to the pin never reach it. A settings default model does not
 *   either: `--model` wins before any extension runs.
 * - `context`, `context_with_system` and `before_provider_request`: Pi's current
 *   model is the pin before each conversation request.
 * - `before_provider_request`: the model id inside the outgoing payload is the one
 *   Pi sends for the pin, for the APIs listed in PAYLOAD_MODEL_FIELD. This sees
 *   a rewrite made by a handler that ran before this one, and none made after it.
 *
 * Model calls an extension makes itself are outside this guard.
